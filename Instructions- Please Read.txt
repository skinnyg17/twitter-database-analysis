Intructions-

**** The username for admin account is "Karthik", and password is "W1nallday!". *****
**** The username for non-admin account is "Ganesh", and password is "1dayUmay!". ****

This is based on what I inserted into the userapp table on the Group4 Database, but you can add other users too using the below insert statements- 

• If you want to add an admin, use "admin" for the role. Example- insert into userapp(username, userpassword,userrole) values ("Karthik",SHA1("W1nallday!"),"admin");

• For non admins use "other" instead of "admin" for the role. Example- insert into userapp(username, userpassword,userrole) values ("Ganesh",SHA1("1dayUmay!"),"other");
